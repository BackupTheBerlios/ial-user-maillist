Subject: [Ial-user] initial: how to use it correctly
Message-ID: <200601121755.40950.fdoffizi@libero.it>

I installed initial cause I had not been able to set ial to catch all my fn 
keys (toshiba 5200-801) and used it to set up other rules but I noticed that 
they work only if initial is loaded in systray.
Is there a way to convert .initial settings in ial static rules?
Where can I find some documentation about ial configuration?

Thanks

Francesco
